# Deployment
Designed to be deployed on Heroku, but should be adaptable to any service.

1. Copy the master key encrypting your rails prod credentials [config/credentials/production.key](config/credentials/production.key) and make it available on your server as an environment variable `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`.
2. You can also set `RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES` to `disabled` if you want.

## Purge data > 2 days old from DB using Heroku Scheduler
A rake task [`rake nightly_data_purge`](lib/tasks/nightly_data_purge.rake) is set up to purge old messages/users/other data from the DB. This is intended to be run nightly by a [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) task, but you could use any task scheduling system to run it.

Add the free Heroku Scheduler addon to your app and then configure it with:
1. Run every day at 12:00am UTC
2. Run command: `rake nightly_data_purge`

# Local Development
## Install
1. Install postgres, ruby, bundler, heroku CLI.
2. `bundle install`
3. Setup database or whatever.
4. Configure options in rails credentials (example: [credentials.sample.yml](./config/credentials.sample.yml)).
  - App expects two credentials files:
    - `config/credentials/production.yml.enc` (`config/credentials/production.key`) is for production only
    - `config/credentials.yml.enc` (`config/master.key`) is for dev & test

### Optional: justfile convenience scripts
1. Install just
2. Copy `/justfile.sample` to `/justfile`, then edit any indicated values.
3. Or just copy the scripts from it into your favorite tool.

## Run local dev env (bot listener polls telegram, no webhook)
* `just run`

  aka

* `heroku local --procfile=Procfile.dev`

## Run linter & tests
* `just test`

  (aka `rubocop` and `rspec` in parallel)
