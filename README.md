# DogBot üê∂

## Commands
### `/summarize`

### `/vibe_check`
Analyze chat members' moods

### `/stats`

## Features & Ideas
- [ ] LLM chatroom summarization
  - [x] Aware of reply threads
  - [x] Aware of media presence (photo/video) & captions on media
  - [ ] "Vibe check" summary of users' moods
  - [ ] Feed previous summaries back into LLM prompt for longer "memory"
    * (`/summarize_past_summaries` command?)
- [ ] Some UI to jump to previous summary in telegram (next summary btn would be cool too)
- [ ] Rake task which auto-deletes old messages
- [ ] Jannie features
  - [ ] Granular authorization: only admins/mods can execute commands, etc.
  - [ ] Customizable old-message-deletion timeframe
- [ ] Summarize links somehow:
  - [ ] Maybe if `/summarize` command is followed by a URL
  - [ ] or `/summarize` command is a reply to another msg containing a URL
