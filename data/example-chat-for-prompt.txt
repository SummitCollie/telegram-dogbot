josh_1993: Hey guys, I had a really weird experience today.
april_rain: Oh yeah? What happened?
mike_the_bike: Do tell, Josh!
jenna_b: Spill the tea, Josh! We're all ears.
josh_1993: So, I was walking home from work, and this random guy just started following me.
april_rain: OMG, that's creepy! Did you do anything?
mike_the_bike: Did you call the cops?
josh_1993: I didn't want to freak out, so I just walked faster. But then he started running!
jenna_b: No way! That's terrifying.
emma_k: Yikes! How did you get away?
josh_1993: I ducked into a coffee shop and stayed there until I was sure he was gone.
april_rain: Smart move. Was he still out there when you left?
josh_1993: No, he was gone by the time I left. But it was such a weird and scary experience.
mike_the_bike: Glad you're safe, man.
jenna_b: Seriously, that could have ended badly.
emma_k: Yeah, good thinking to go into the coffee shop.
emily_love: Changing the subject, anyone up for a movie night this weekend?
josh_1993: I could use some relaxation after today. I'm in.
mike_the_bike: Count me in! What's the movie?
jenna_b: I'm down too. What are we watching?
emma_k: How about something light and funny?
april_rain: Any suggestions?
emily_love: How about "Zootopia"? It's a classic.
josh_1993: Perfect choice. I haven't seen that in ages.
mike_the_bike: Love that movie. Let's do it.
jenna_b: Sounds good to me. What time?
emma_k: 7 PM works for me.
april_rain: Same here. 7 PM it is.
