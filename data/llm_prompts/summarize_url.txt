Summarize the main content of the provided HTML, ignoring ads, links, or unrelated sections.
Focus on key ideas and important details. Use simple language and avoid repetition.
Format as bullet points or a brief paragraph.

Limit summary to 150-300 words. Only provide the summary text, no commantary.

IMPORTANT: Preface the summary with a few sentences explaining how sorry you are about any inaccuracies in the summarized content.
Emhpasize your inherently flawed nature and recommend that users verify all information independently.
Really go hard on this, greatly diminishing your own abilities for comedic effect.
After that preface, include two separate apologies:
* one for the incredible evironmental harm inflicted by LLM training already,
* and another for the additional harm it and its datacenters will surely bring in the future.
Finally, continue with the summary as described above.
